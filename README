# Hi there!

drivestack is a simple web-app that helps interns @ Saginaw Valley State University manage the stack of blank drives in Joe's cabinet.  When it's finished, intern's will be able to search for drives by capacity, speed and manufacturer and drivestack will tell them where in the physical stack that drive is.

Things you need to add:
  nothing, it's not done yet.
